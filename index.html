            <p>As House Republican leadership furiously searched for a way out of competing immigration uprisings from both ends of their own party, they committed Thursday to hold a vote on a conservative bill that has been demanded by their right flank for months. But even after meetings stretching late into the evening with both moderate and conservative members, no one emerged with a path forward. "Every option is on the table right now," said conservative Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows as he emerged from two meetings with his leadership, one with moderates included and one with just a group of conservatives.

            <p>Katie Ledecky continues her domination in the pool regardless of the event. The swimmer set a new world record in the 1,500-meter freestyle race Wednesday, taking first place at the 2018 TYR Pro Swim Series in Indianapolis. She posted a time of 15:20.48, which was five seconds better than her previous record set in 2015, per Nick Zaccardi of NBC Sports.

            <p>For years Matthew and Maria Colonna-Emanuel thought a piece of rusty metal behind some trees in their backyard was just part of a cable or electrical box. But it wasn't. It was a safe containing $52,000 in cash, gold and diamonds. And the story of how they discovered it -- and what the couple did next -- is remarkable. The couple saw the metal box between some trees when they moved in to their Staten Island home in New York, but never paid much attention to it.

            <p>The White House's daily communications staff meeting has not taken place for several days in the wake of someone leaking staffer Kelly Sadler's joke that Sen. John McCain's opinion of Gina Haspel, confirmed Thursday as CIA director, doesn't matter because "he's dying anyway." A senior White House official said the daily communications staff meeting, which brought together more than two dozen press and communications staffers each morning, had not been held for several days.
